Q1.Explain the purpose of the send() method of ClientHandler
To send line to only one client.

Q2.Where is the line in send() going to?
A:It is going to each clients.

Q3.Explain the purpose of the toString() method of ClientHandler
A:To be a getter method of Id.

Q4.When a client closes a connection and terminates, and then a 
new client connects, is the client number recycled? Why or why not?
A:No. Based on line 53:id = "client_"+ ++count;,whenever a new client
connects with, instead of recycling numbers, server gives the,
client a new number.

Q5.List the lines of code executed when the ChatServer starts up to 
the point where it is listening for its first connection. 
The list should be in execution order.
A:new ChatServer().startServer(Integer.parseInt(args[0]));
13  ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
22  System.err.println("ChatServer started");
23  while (true) {
24  ClientHandler ch = new ClientHandler(serverSocket.accept());
25  System.err.println("Accepted connection from " + ch);
26  synchronized (clients) {
27  clients.add(ch);
Q6.If 3 clients have connected to ChatServer, how many threads 
are running assuming no client has terminated. 
Include the client threads in your count.
A:Each client holds 3 and server holds 4. There are 13 of threads in all.

Q7.Describe what each thread from Q6 is doing. 
For threads which are performing the same task but for different clients,
you should state how many of that particular thread is running. 
If you did not correctly answer Q6, complete this question after
you get the correct answer and before you leave the lab. 
You will not get the mark for this lab until both questions 
are answered correctly
A:There are 3 clients, each client holds its own main method and other two start() methods.While server holds its own main method and other three threads for 3 clients.
